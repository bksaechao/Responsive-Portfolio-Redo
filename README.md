### *(Follow up notes)*
<ul>
  <li>
    This assignment was more challenging than I iniitially thought it would be and more challenging than I remember it to be tbh.
  </li>
  <li>
    Finished in one sitting, but ran into many hiccups and bugs and was stumped for a while on how to solve some issues. The portfolio page was the most challenging due to my initial code not being optimized for media queries so I had to re-do the whole page.
  </li>
  <li>
    I've been trying to start from scratch and avoid using previous code as reference, but this time around it was necesssary to get over some hurdles.
  </li>
  <li>
    I need to improve use of proper syntax and common practice methods in web dev.
  </li>
  <li>
    Although it was challenging, comprehension was much stronger this time around!
